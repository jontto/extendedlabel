ExtendedLabel
=============

Vaadin Label component that can parse a number of different markup syntaxes.

## Version numbering

I follow the versioning scheme of MAJOR.MINOR.VAADINVERSION, where VAADINVERSION is either 6 or 7 depending which 
version you look at.

Minor versions includes bugfixes and minor enhancement, while new syntaxes are added and other major changes are 
made to major versions. 

## Markup syntax's supported

- Creole
- Markdown
- Textile

## Branches

The main branch for now is for Vaadin 6, there will be at least one additional branch for Vaadin 7 component.

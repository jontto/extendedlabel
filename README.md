ExtendedLabel
=============

Vaadin Label component that can parse a number of different markup syntaxes.

## Version numbering

I follow the versioning scheme of VERSION.VAADINVERSION, where VAADINVERSION is either 6 or 7 depending which 
version you look at.

VERSION is just a running number of releases without any more detailed information.

## Markup syntax's supported

- Creole
- Markdown
- Textile

## Branches

The main branch for now is for Vaadin 6 and there is another branch for the Vaadin 7 component.
